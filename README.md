# Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition

This repository contains my coursework for the 4th Year [Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlpr) course, taken in 2011/2012. The MLPR course had one piece of coursework, that involved a number of machine-learning related questions and some work on implementing [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) and performing a classification task.

Coursework for other courses can be found in my main [University Coursework](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University) repository.
